        <p>
            I'm currently a second year Computer Science student at 
            McGill university specializing in Artificial Intelligence 
            who is open to 2025 Summer Internships and co-ops. I have 
            experience in programming languages such as Java, Python, 
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C. I am also proficient in object
            oriented design and am able to utilize APIs in web development. 
            My academic journey at McGill has equipped me with a strong 
            foundation in computer science principles, and I am eager to 
            apply these in internships and projects.

                        Used the CSS box model and flex box to change the

                        visually appealing for the user. Additionally, incorporated 
                        responsive design and web accessibility to the designs to

                        Developed a remote control using MediaPipe that

                        Created an algorithm that calculated the player's

                        with a similar bpm using a Spotify API to make their
